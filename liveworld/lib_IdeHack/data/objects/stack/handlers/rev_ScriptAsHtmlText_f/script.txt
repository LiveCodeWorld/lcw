   # Description
   #   This command returns the current script as *real* html. The result of this command
   #   is suitable for displaying in a browser, not in Revolution fields as htmlText. This command
   #   requires the colorization scheme "Revolution Classic" to be used as it contains hard-coded 
   #   replacements. For html suitable for printing or displaying in a Revolution field see scriptGetHtmlText.
