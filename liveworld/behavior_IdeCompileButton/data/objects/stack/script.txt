/*
Was "Livecode Compile Button". We now use before and after handlers.
It may be more robust to wrap "actionCompile" with an after handler rather than "mouseUp"

The command "actionCompile pIgnoreErrors" can be found in the stack "revSEStackbehavior"
# Parameters
#   pIgnoreErrors : whether or not to ignore compilation errors (optional, defaults to false)
# Returns
#   the number of compilation errors encountered.
# Description
#   Attempts to compile the script of object currently being edited. If compile errors occur, adds these to the errors pane,
#   the script is applied regardless of whether errors ocurred or not. The stack is marked as edited.
